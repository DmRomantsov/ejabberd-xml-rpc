# sc-ejabberd-admin
Just a library to handle with the ejabberd admin commands.

If you use Ejabberd, you may know about the Admin api

https://docs.ejabberd.im/admin/api/

So, i decided to create this library to use into my project, because it will make easy to automate many features requested by my client. Now i am living this library(not full yet) here with the hope that may can help others.

Thanks.
